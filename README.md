## SELF QUANTIFIED  
The 'self quantified' app is used for self-tracking - tracking habits, activities, other life parameters, etc.  
User can login to the app and can create multiple trackers.  
CRUD operations can be done on trackers and their logs.  
Flask microframework is used to build the controller of the app and SQLite database is used to keep the details of the users.  

- flask is used to create the app.
- matplotlib is used to plot the graphs of each tracker showing the  logs of the tracker.
- flask_login helps in tracking the login id of the user.
- flask_sqlalchemy is used to connect to the SQLite database.
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for Frontend

Please install the Python packages from requirements.txt using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the app.
